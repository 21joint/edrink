                    <p><strong>The need</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Salt Lake is experiencing a new urbanism that supports a thriving and vibrant culinary
                        community. As the valley changes, its tastes are changing with it. The growth of chef-driven and
                        owned restaurants and rise of craft beverages, urban wineries and distilleries are elevating the
                        city’s palate.</p>
                    <p>Not just a food festival that happens to feature a few wineries, not just a wine festival with
                        some food to nibble on — Eat Drink SLC is a true communion between food and drink, pairing a
                        diverse group of independently owned local restaurants with complementary wineries, distilleries
                        and breweries. Eat Drink SLC’s format promotes the marriage of food and libations in a way
                        unduplicated by other Utah events.</p>

                        “One of my fav foodie events last year! One of the few where the drinks are right up there with
                        the food.” — Julie, EDSLC attendee</p>
                    <p>“It’s exciting to see Salt Lake’s burgeoning ‘foodie culture’ and all it brings to Salt Lake.
                        We’re thrilled to be a part of Eat Drink SLC as it celebrates our community’s flourishing food
                        and drink scene and the purveyors that are making it all possible.” — Scott Beck, President/CEO
                        of Visit Salt Lake, one of the event’s sponsors</p>
                    <p>“I and most of the attendees I spoke to were very impressed—not just by the excellent food
                        provided by an array of local restaurants, nor by the bevy of beverages, but by the organization
                        and smooth flow of the entire event.” — <a
