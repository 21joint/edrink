                    <p>Head Brewer Rio Connelly creates stellar beers the way he wants them. “Since I was a young
                        brewer, it has been more about the process than the product,” says Rio. His affinity for
                        crushing grains and combining unlikely ingredients has made his beer sought after all over town.
                        One of Rio’s objectives is to see a resurgence in regional styles, something missing from the
                        U.S. since Prohibition.</p>

                    <p>Uinta’s mission is to brew world class, full-flavored, craft-brewed beer. It is named after a
                        mountain range located in northeastern Utah. Many of the beer names are inspired by Utah’s
                        diverse landscapes or have historical significance. Cutthroat Pale Ale, Uinta’s flagship beer,
                        is named after Utah’s state fish. Subsequent beer names followed suit, such as King’s Peak
                        Porter, named after Utah’s highest peak, Golden Spike Hefeweizen, named after the spike used to
                        commemorate the completion of the transcontinental railroad in Utah, and Dubhe, named after the
                        Utah Centennial star.</p>
